## Problem 1
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```
**Description:**. 
This dataset contains online grocery data from a online grocery platform called instacart. The size of this dataset is `1384617` rows and `15` columns. There are four variables are `character variables` including evaluation set, product name, aisle and department. The rest of variables are all `integer variables`. In total, it has 15 variables including `order id, product id, customer id, aisle name, department name` and so on. Department name provide general type information of that specific product and then aisle name provide the detail information about which type of product this one belongs to. From the dataset, we can know lots from information. For example, order number 1 contains 4 Bulgarian Yogurt that has its product id to be 49302. This Bulgarian Yogurt belongs to dairy eggs department and also yogurt aisle.  

#### The Total number of Aisles 
```{r}
number_aisle<-
  instacart|>
  count(aisle_id,aisle,sort=TRUE)
```
There are `134` aisle in total within this instacart dataset. `Fresh vagetable` aisle is the most items ordered from.  

#### Plot  
```{r}
number_aisle|>
  filter(n>10000)|>
  ggplot(aes(x=aisle_id,y=n))+
  geom_point()+
  xlim(c(0, 140)) + 
  ylim(c(0, 160000)) + 
  labs(y="Number of Items Ordered", 
       x="Aisle ID", 
       title="Scatterplot of Number of Items Ordered in Each Aisle", 
       )
```
  
From this plot, we can clearly see that there are two specific aisles that most items ordered from.  

#### Table 

```{r}
instacart |> 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) |>
  group_by(aisle) |> 
  count(product_name) |> 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) |> 
  filter(rank < 4) |> 
  arrange(desc(n)) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

#### Table 

```{r}
instacart |>
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) |>
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) |>
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) |>
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow, 
    values_from = mean_hour) |>
  knitr::kable(digits = 2)
```

## Problem 2
```{r}
library(p8105.datasets)
data("brfss_smart2010")
```
  
#### Clean the data
```{r}
brfss_smart2010_clean<-
  brfss_smart2010|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  filter(topic=="Overall Health")|>
  filter(response==c("Excellent", "Very good", "Good", "Fair", "Poor"))|>
  mutate(response=factor(response, levels = c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent"), ordered = TRUE))
```

```{r}
brfss_state2002<-brfss_smart2010_clean|>
  filter(year=="2002")|>
  group_by(locationdesc)|>
  summarize(n_obs1=n())|>
  separate(locationdesc,into=c("state", "location"),sep='-')|>
  group_by(state)|>
  summarize(n_obs2=n())|>
  filter(n_obs2>=7)

brfss_state2010<-brfss_smart2010_clean|>
  filter(year=="2010")|>
  group_by(locationdesc)|>
  summarize(n_obs1=n())|>
  separate(locationdesc,into=c("state", "location"),sep='-')|>
  group_by(state)|>
  summarize(n_obs2=n())|>
  filter(n_obs2>=7)
```
In 2002, `no` states were observed at 7 or more locations. In 2010, there are `9` states were oboserved at 7 or more locations.

#### “Spaghetti” plot
```{r}
#Constract dataset
brfss_excellent<-
  brfss_smart2010_clean|>
  filter(response=="Excellent")|>
  select(year,locationabbr,data_value)|>
  group_by(year,locationabbr)|> 
  summarize(mean_data_value=mean(data_value))
#Making plot
ggplot(brfss_excellent,aes(x=year,y=mean_data_value,group=locationabbr,color=locationabbr)) +
  geom_line()+
  xlim(c(2002, 2010)) + 
  ylim(c(5, 35)) + 
  labs(y="Years", 
       x="Mean Data Value", 
       title="“Spaghetti” plot of average data value over time", 
       )
```  
Based on this plot, we will be able to see the average data value from 2002 to 2010 in different states. Generally, we can see that the lowest point of average data value in all states is located in the year of 2005. 
#### Two-panel Plot
```{r}
brfss_two_panal<-
  brfss_smart2010_clean|>
  filter(locationabbr=="NY",year=="2006"|year=="2010")|> 
  select(year,data_value,locationdesc,response)

ggplot(brfss_two_panal, aes(x=response, y=data_value,group=locationdesc,color=locationdesc)) +
geom_line()+
labs(y="Data Value", 
       x="Response", 
       title="Two-panel Plot of Data Value over Responses in 2006 and 2010 among Locations", 
       )+
facet_grid(.~ year) 
```
We can see that there are only four locations that have been recorded in 2006. However, in 2010, the dataset included more data from more locations in the NY states. Generally speaking, the data value increases as the response move from `poor` to `good`. Then, data value from most locations will continue experiencing an short increase from `good` to `very good` response, but after that, these data value will decrease from `good` to `excellent` response. However, for the data value from Queens in 2006 and for the data from Bronx, Queens and Kings in 2010, they experienced the decrease started from `good` response.   

## Problem 3  

#### Clean the dataset
```{r}
nhanes_accel_df= read_csv("data/nhanes_accel.csv")|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  drop_na()|>
  mutate(seqn=as.character(seqn))

nhanes_covar_df= read_csv("data/nhanes_covar.csv",skip=4)|>
  janitor::clean_names()|>
  filter(age>=21,)|>
  drop_na()|>
  mutate(seqn=as.character(seqn))|>
  mutate(sex=factor(sex))|>
  mutate(education=factor(education))

nhanes_covar_df$education<-factor(nhanes_covar_df$education, levels=1:3, labels = c("Less than High School", "High School equivalent", "More than High School"))

nhanes_covar_df$sex<-factor(nhanes_covar_df$sex, levels=1:2, labels = c("Male", "Female"))

merged_nhanes <- inner_join(nhanes_covar_df,nhanes_accel_df, by = "seqn")

```  

#### Create a table& Age Distribution
```{r}
sex_education_table<-table(nhanes_covar_df$sex, nhanes_covar_df$education)
sex_education_df <- as.data.frame.matrix(sex_education_table)
print(sex_education_df)
```

```{r}
ggplot(nhanes_covar_df, aes(x = education, y = age, fill = sex)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(
    title = "Boxplot of Age Distributions for Gender by Education Category",
    x = "Education Category",
    y = "Age"
  ) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Male" = "skyblue", "Female" = "pink")) 
```

Based on the Boxplot, we can see that the age distribution for men and women are similar to each other in the `Less than High School` and `More than High School` Education Category. However, in the `High School equivalent` category, female are relatively older than male based on this dataset. 
  
#### Total Activity Plot
```{r}
merged_nhanes$total_activity<-rowSums(merged_nhanes[,6:1445])
ggplot(merged_nhanes, aes(x = age, y = total_activity,group=sex, color=sex)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Activities vs Age",
    x = "Age",
    y = "Total Activity"
  ) +
  facet_grid(.~ education) 
```   

Based on this plot, the total activities decreases when people get older and older across all three education category for both men and women. For people who received `less than high school` education, they have two high total activity periods in their lifetime. One of them locates at around 20 years old and the other peak is at around 58 years old. Women have higher total activities than men earlier in their life and men have their higher activities than women later in life.For people who received `High School equivalent` education, they have only one total activity peak during their life. This one big peak located at around 40 years old for both men and women. For `More than High School` category, their total activity over their lifetime is relatively stable. Generally speaking, women have higher total activities than men for `High School equivalent` and `More than High School` category.   

#### 24-hour Activity Plot
```{r}

minutes <- seq(from = 1, to = 1440, by = 1)

new_nhanes_accel_df<-
  pivot_longer(nhanes_accel_df,min1:min1440,
               names_prefix = "min",
               names_to = "minutes",
               values_to = "activity")
nhanes <- inner_join(nhanes_covar_df,new_nhanes_accel_df,by = "seqn")

ggplot(nhanes, aes(x = minutes , y = activity, group=sex, color=sex)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = sex),alpha=0.2)+
  geom_smooth(aes(color = sex), se = FALSE, linetype = "longdash") +
  labs(
    title = "Activities vs Minutes",
    x = "Minutes",
    y = "Activities"
  )+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Male" = "dodgerblue", "Female" = "deeppink"))+
  facet_grid(.~ education)
```

The distribution of the data can be seen in line plot. From the smooth line, we can see that both women and men show similar patterns among three different education categories. However, based on the line, we can see that male from higher eductaion level tends to have more activities in the morning, and women from higher education level tends to have more activities in the afternoon.
